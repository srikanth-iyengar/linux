# Access Control
**With great power comes great responsibility**

## Standard unix access control
Unix standard access control model has remained largely unchanged for decades
With a few enhancements, it continues to be the default for general purpose os distributions


- Access control decisions depends on which user is attempting to perform an operation, in some cases in which group
the user belongs to
- Objects have owners. Owners have broad control over these objects
- You own the objects you create
- The special super user also known as "root" can be owner of any object
- Only root can perform certain sensitive administrative operation
